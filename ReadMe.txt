Default examples folder are for Universal Render Pipeline!

If you are using different render pipeline remove "Examples" folder.
Import the relevant Render Pipeline Unitypackage.

If you are importing Built-In Render Pipeline, then you must use Shader Graph 12.0.0 (Unity 2021.2) and newer.
Also use Linear Color Space for Built-in Render Pipeline, in Gamma Color Space colors looks different.
